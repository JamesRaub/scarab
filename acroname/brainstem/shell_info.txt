                aRobot Shell Information

If you choose to serve the aRobot API using the 
aRobotAgent application, you can then log in to the API
as a TCP/IP client from any machine that can access the 
machine running the agent code.  This shell is called 
the aRobotShell program and it is a very simple client
for the API that lets you view the properties for a 
given API and also set/get the values of these 
properties.

RUNNING

To run the shell, you only need to specify the IP 
address and port where the agent is running. 
For example:

aRobotShell 192.168.1.220 8008

Port 8008 is the default port for both the aRobotAgent
and the aRobotShell.

COMMANDS

There are only a few commands for the shell.  

  help - Shows the command list.

  exit - Exits the shell.

  properties - lists the properties in the current object

  objects - Lists the child objects at the current level.

  set - Sets the value of a property with an example.

       > set pwm_output 1000

  get - Gets the value for a specified property.

       > get pwm_output

  rget - Gets continual updates for a given property.

       > rget pwm_output

  co - Change object to a child object.

       > co arm

  document - Generate documentation for a given object.

       > document html

             The document ends up in the aAsset
             directory.

The shell is a great way to browse the property tree
for a given aRobot API.
