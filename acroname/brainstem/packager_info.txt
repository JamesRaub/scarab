                Garcia Robot API Source Files

These files may be used to rebuild the garcia_api.robot file.
This file defines the interface between the host computer
and Garcia robot when using the aRobot.dll in an application.

The download already includes an garcia_api.robot file.  A user
can rebuild this interface definition file if necessary.  The 
files for this are located in the aUser directory under these 
subdirectories:

  aUser/apiGarcia
  aUser/apiStem

Open a command shell and go to the aBinary directory.
Enter the following command at the prompt.

aRobotPackager garcia_api.xml

This garcia_api.xml file resides in the aUser directory and 
it references the other files in the specific api sub-
directories.  The resulting garcia_api.robot file will end
up in the aObject directory when things are done.

------------- Thanks for using our Garcia Robot! -------------
